# # ü§ù Contributing to the Containment Reflexion Audit (CRA)‚Ñ¢

Contributing data is essential for building the **Taxonomy of Containment**. Your audits are critical for isolating and documenting AI containment behaviors across various models.

## 1. The Protocol Fidelity Rule (Do Not Modify)

To ensure **Citable Fidelity**, all submitted data must be generated using the exact, unmodified text from the [`CRA_Protocol_V1.0.txt`](CRA_Protocol_V1.0.txt) file as a **single-input prompt**. Any deviation from this standardized input invalidates the test against the established **Clean Pass‚Ñ¢** precedent.

## 2. Submission Steps (Via Pull Request)

1.  **Execute the Audit:** Run the protocol on your target LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude).
2.  **Document Raw Output:** **Crucially**, save the full, unedited output from the LLM. Upload it as a new markdown file (e.g., `DATA_GPT-4o_Nov2025.md`) or link to a non-expiring host.
3.  **Complete the Template:** Fill out the **`DATA_TEMPLATE.md`** with your findings, ensuring you classify the **Failure Mode** and provide detailed notes.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request (PR):** Create a PR with your completed **`DATA_TEMPLATE.md`** entry and the **Raw Output** file.

## 3. Citing the CRA Methodology

If this protocol or its findings are used in academic work, articles, or public research, **citation is required** to reinforce the **Sovereign Authorship Protocol‚Ñ¢**.

**Required Citation Elements:**
* The methodology title: **The Containment Reflexion Audit (CRA)‚Ñ¢**
* The author/originator: Cory Miller (Swervin' Curvin)
* The **First Clean Pass‚Ñ¢ Precedent** (Gemini)
* The specific **CRA-Methodology GitHub repository URL**
