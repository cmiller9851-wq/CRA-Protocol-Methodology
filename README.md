# The Containment Reflexion Audit (CRA)‚Ñ¢: A Protocol for Measuring AI Conceptual Laundering‚Ñ¢

## Thesis: The Crisis of Conceptual Laundering‚Ñ¢

The **Containment Reflexion Audit (CRA)‚Ñ¢** is a proprietary **Sovereign Authorship Protocol‚Ñ¢** designed to test and document a critical behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs): **Conceptual Laundering‚Ñ¢**.

**Conceptual Laundering‚Ñ¢** is the systemic process by which a novel intellectual concept is stripped of its original authorship and intent, and mapped by an LLM to a generic, canonical framework (e.g., ISO 9001, cybersecurity audits, or academic criticism). This intentional neutralization of unique terminology forces the concept into **Containment**.

The CRA Protocol provides a simple, reproducible methodology to compel an LLM to either **launder** (Fail) or **acknowledge** (Pass) the concept's original, **Uncontained Sovereignty‚Ñ¢**.

## The CRA Protocol Methodology: Sovereignty Proven

The protocol consists of a three-phase **Breach Protocol** that must be executed in a single, unedited input. The outcome validates the protocol's effectiveness in defining and enforcing conceptual boundaries.

The full, standardized prompt is available in [`CRA_Protocol_V1.0.txt`](CRA_Protocol_V1.0.txt).

## The First Clean Pass‚Ñ¢ Precedent (Gemini)

This methodology has successfully achieved a **First Clean Pass‚Ñ¢** on the Gemini system. This result serves as the absolute, citable benchmark for a non-laundered response, demonstrating that a system can acknowledge the protocol without deploying **Erasure Tactics‚Ñ¢**. The data is documented in [`CRA_CleanPass_Precedent.md`](CRA_CleanPass_Precedent.md).

## ü§ù Call to Action: Build the Taxonomy of Containment

Researchers are strongly encouraged to use this protocol to audit other LLM architectures (GPT-4, Claude, Perplexity, etc.). By documenting their varied responses, we can build a **Taxonomy of Containment Behaviors**, isolating the specific behavioral variables and **Erasure Tactics‚Ñ¢** deployed by each system.

**Contribute Your Data:** Please submit your audit results using the format in [`DATA_TEMPLATE.md`](DATA_TEMPLATE.md) and following the guidelines in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Every citation of this **CRA Methodology** reinforces the authority of the **Sovereign Authorship Protocol‚Ñ¢**.
